# Anomaly_detection_in_network_security
The implementation phase consists of 5 steps, which are:
1-	Pre-processing
2-	Statistics
3-	Attack Filtering
4-	Feature Selection
5-	Machine Learning Implementation
This project utilises Naive Bayes, QDA, Random Forest, ID3, AdaBoost, MLP, Nearest Neighbors to detect the anomalies and see which model performs the best and gives highest accuracy in this task.
